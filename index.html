			<br>		
            <p>Since the turn of the century, climate change and increasing population have contributed to the endangerment of several wildlife species, but few have been as severely affected as tigers. They have lost over 95% of their historical range, and from over 100000 tigers in the 1900s, we are down to less than 4000 tigers left in the wild presently. That is a 96% drastic decrease. Three subspecies have gone extinct, a fourth mostly extinct in the wild. Although trade in tiger parts is internationally banned, illegal tiger trade still accounts for a big part of a $20 billion/year illegal wildlife market. With their habitat under increasing threat from agricultural developments, deforestation and climate change, it should come as no surprise that confirmed breeding populations exist in only 8 countries worldwide.</p>
            <p>However, after a century of decline, overall wild tiger numbers are starting to tick upward. India, that accounts for over 70% of the tiger population, has had major success with their tiger conservation efforts. Project Save Our Tigers, a joint initiative between WCT, NDTV, Aircel and Sanctuary Asia, took off in 2008, and has implemented multiple stages of their conservation program in collaboration with governmental and non-governmental organizations to bring the tiger population in India back from the brink of extinction. This has been just one of several tiger conservation efforts implemented by the countryâ€™s central government to save its national animal. The extremely low number of 1411 tigers in 2006 is what spurred the Indian government into action, and based on current data, the tiger population now stands at 2967, more than double of that in 2006. This has been one of India's most successful wildlife conservation projects. </p>
			<p>The goal of this project is to visualize the tiger population over the years in India, based on governmental data. These visualizations will include both static and interactive visualizations. The end goal is to use these visualizations to help find out the extent to which these efforts were successful and in addition how they can be improved in the future to safeguard the tiger population.</p><br>

    <h2>Future Work</h2>

    <section>
		<p>Our interactive explainer project aims to raise awareness about tiger conservation efforts. By providing multiple interactive visualization idioms, we hope a wide range of users can benefit and enjoy from the variety of options to interact with the data. Further, based on our data, we hope to find trends and analyse how conservation efforts have fared in several states and regions in India over time and where such efforts might need to be improved. We also hope that analysis of such data helps emphasize the need for conservation data to be more easily available on public forums.</p>  
		<p>For future work, we would like to perform such analysis on a global scale, and for multiple species. We hope such projects raise awareness about wildlife conservation while also helping every wildlife organization and governments, analyze and improve their conservation efforts.
